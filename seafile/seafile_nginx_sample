# This config is a sample of setting up seafile in the reverse proxy layer
# Nginx server if the reverse proxy is to be set up nativelly on the host
# machine. Note that the docker-compose.yml does set up a nginx-reverse-proxy
# and letsencrypt-companion as docker containers, and this file should not be
# used in that case.
# This file is supposed to be an example to setup seafile vhost on a natively
# installed nginx proxy.
# This file assumes the SSL certificate will be handled by CertBot with
# certificates provided by LetsEncrypt.

# Seafile is supposed to store big files some time.
